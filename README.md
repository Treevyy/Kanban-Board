  ## Description
  The Kanban Board is a full-stack task management application that helps agile teams organize their work with a visual interface. Users can securely log in to view and manage their tasks across three categories: To Do, In Progress, and Done.

  This project implements JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication to ensure secure access. JWTs are used to verify user identities and authorize requests, enabling a seamless and protected experience across the platform.
